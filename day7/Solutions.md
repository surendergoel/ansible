DAY 7 ANSIBLE

Assignment 1
Using Ansible Modules, Create Swap memory using swap File if Swap does not exist in the node machine , if it exists increase the swap Size.
Solution :-
First, I did the whole process manually.
I checked the swap space on my vagrant node by using command “free -h”.
Created a swap file using command  module of ansible & using
dd if=/dev/zero of=/test/swpfl bs=10M count=1
Setup the swap file using
mkswap /test/swpfl
For making the file more secure i give permissions to the file as 600.
Enabled the swpfl file using  swapon /test/swpfl command
Added the file permanently by adding it to fstab file.
Enabled the swap space using swapon -a.
A 9.2M swap space made on the node using ‘dd’ but its not used to make swap space for more than 1GB then we can use fallocate command.
Then I created the playbook by giving hosts -> node2 and created various task according to study from google and performing it manually with snapshots.
